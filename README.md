Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot, video recordings or a gif. Try to tell us about the solution you built by answering the following:

- Where can I see your demo?
- demo <https://authentica-ten.vercel.app/>

- What was your experience building it.
intringing and chalenging but surely worth it

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/musahibrahimali/authentica

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start

# rename the .env.local file and fill in with the correct api credentials 
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
